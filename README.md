# Pastel Material Color Scheme

#### A dark color scheme for Sublime Text using pastel tones of Google's Material Design colorspace

Using the Base16 Dark Ocean colorscheme as a template I decided to create a colorscheme using the Spaceblack background color as well as pastel-like colors from Google's Materal Design colorspace.
It's a subtle, yet playful theme that doesn't get annoying or distracting even after a long coding session.
